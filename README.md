# roker
Route ngrok URL to static URL

"I am overwhelmed by configuring URL on API service like Slack everytime I start my Ngrok server".
then this might be solution.

## how??
- **Fork this repository**
- **create account on heroku**

## configuration
- **deploy the forked version on your heroku**
- **config your URL by setting heroku enviroment:** `URL`=`secure-ngrok-url`
- **you might need to restart your app everytime you change this environment**

## final
`instead of using ngrok link` just use your `heroku link`

## contributions
are very welcome 🙏🙏🙏🙏
